        <td>In WP8 verification and validation procedures will be implemented for each of the software components of the proposed project. Thus it will be an ongoing procedure during the project Standard procedures will be followed when existing codes are applicable. An extensive survey of the existing scientific literature and technological standards will be conducted. Verification and validation methods will apply, where applicable, existing acknowledged methodologies.</td>

        <td>Involves the process of ensuring that the conceptual model has been carefully transformed into a computer model with sufficient accuracy; in other words, it has a mathematical concern of building the model right. Early verification tests will be applied during the development of each module in order to correct unexpected deviations.</td>

        <td>Involves the process of ensuring that the conceptual model is sufficiently accurate to represent the real world from the perspective of its intended uses; in other words, it has the physical concern of building the right model. It will be applied only after the verification has been done. Standard experiment outcomes will be considered.</td>

        <td>The scientific and technical outcomes of the project will be published in the best journals in the field of computational engineering and sciences, as well as in journals specialized in structural engineering, fire-safety and computational modelling of human behaviour. It is also planned to present the developed methods and achieve results in selected international conferences and workshops in those fields as well as to specialized exhibitions.</td>
