        <td>In WP3 the robustness analysis component (ROBST) will be developed. During progressive collapse events, the majority of people located in collapsed areas of the building are typically killed or seriously injured. By taking under consideration test cases such as sudden column losses, a module that will assess the structural robustness will be developed. Nonlinear static response, dynamic assessment and ductility assessment are crucial factors of the collapse assessment of building structures. ROBST component of IMSAFER software will determine potential collapse by analyzing the structural response of a building for the case where a key structural load-bearing element is removed from the existing structural configuration, while recommendations will also be provided for modifying the design to meet progressive collapse requirements.</td>
