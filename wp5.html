        <td>In WP5 the evacuation management component (EVAC) will be developed. The objective of the EVAC component is to help users to formulate-assess disaster management master plans that cover preparedness, response, and long-term and short-term recovery phases. EVAC will be able to develop specific emergency scenarios including explosions, fires, weather-related emergencies, civil disturbances, communications or power failures, and chemical, biological or radiological hazards and defines the requirements for all aspects of each scenario. The human behaviour and social interactions will be incorporated in a dynamic computational model suitable for safe egress analysis. The computational model will be able to adapt egress analysis suitable for specific design circumstances and provide insight to current prescriptive and often, ambiguous codes and provisions for egress design.</td>
