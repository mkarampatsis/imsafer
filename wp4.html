        <td>Smart buildings and multiple sensors network offer new possibilities in fire-safety. When dealing with fire hazards inside structures, prevention, identification, handling and evacuation are the main topics. A “smart” fast and accurate fire hazard identification and handling component of the BIM software will be developed in WP4. In addition, by means of the FSC component of IMSAFER software it will be possible for the user (fire investigators, safety officials, engineers, architects and builders) to simulate the impact of past or potential fires and smoke in a specific building environment.</td>
