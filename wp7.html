        <td>Integration of components under BIM protocol. The components developed in previous WPs will be integrated into the BIM software. The protocols that will be followed are: (i) Singapore BIM Guide and (ii) USACE, BIM Project Execution Plan. Aiming to blend guidelines for mono and multi-disciplinary modelling together with protocols for implementing BIM in the US Army Corps of Engineer's civil works and military construction processes with a focus on operation phase. A tool will be developed for implementing scenarios of attack. This tool will make possible the implementation of either an accidental scenario or structural elementsâ€™ removal (due to explosion or fire outbreak).</td>
