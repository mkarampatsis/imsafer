        <td><strong>Description:</strong></td>
        <td>In WP6 the risk assessment component (RISK) of the BIM software will be developed, that will involve identifying hazards and estimating potential losses. By means of the developed component, for each manmade hazard scenario the following factors will be able to be addressed: duration (the length of time the hazard is present on the target), dynamic/static characteristic of the hazard, and mitigating conditions. The component will be based on a probabilistic formulation taking into account epistemic and aleatory sources of uncertainty. RISK will be based on a user-friendly methodology while it will be customizable to meet the specific needs of the client organization.</td>
