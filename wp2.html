        <td><strong>Description:</strong></td>
        <td>The software will take into account extreme loadings such as blast-impact and/or fire. Given the dimensions of a building and the size and location of an explosive device, the module will be able to estimate the pressure and impulse distribution on the building facade and maps the results to the 3D model. Complexity in analysing the dynamic response of blast-loaded structures involves the effect of high strain rates, the non-linear inelastic material behaviour, the uncertainties of blast load calculations and the time-dependent deformations. ETABS will be adapted in order to implement blast and fire mitigation techniques both for structural and non-structural members.</td>
